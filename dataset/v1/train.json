For purposes of Code Section 409A (including, without limitation, for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2) (iii)), Executives right to receive any installment payments under this Agreement (whether severance payments, reimbursements or otherwise) shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate payments and, accordingly, each installment payment hereunder shall at all times be considered a separate and distinct payment.

To the extent required to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Code Section 409A, amounts reimbursable to Executive under this Agreement shall be paid to Executive on or before the last day of the year following the year in which the expense was incurred, amounts shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit, and the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement (and in-kind benefits provided to Executive) during any one year may not effect amounts reimbursable or provided in any subsequent year.

To the extent that the termination of the Executives employment does not constitute a separation of service under Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code and Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(h) (as the result of further services that are reasonably anticipated to be provided by the Executive to the Company or any of its parents, subsidiaries or affiliates at the time the Executives employment terminates), any benefits payable under Section 5 that constitute deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code shall be delayed until after the date of a subsequent event constituting a separation of service under Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code and Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(h) . For purposes of clarification, this Section 7(b) shall not cause any forfeiture of benefits on the Executives part, but shall only act as a delay until such time as a separation from service occurs. Further, if the Executive is a specified employee (as that term is used in Section 409A of the Code and regulations and other guidance issued thereunder) on the date his separation from service becomes effective, any benefits payable under Section 5 that constitute non-qualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code shall be delayed until the earlier of (i) the business day following the six-month anniversary of the date his separation from service becomes effective, and (ii) the date of the Executives death, but only to the extent necessary to avoid such penalties under Section 409A of the Code. On the earlier of (i) the business day following the six-month anniversary of the date his separation from service becomes effective, and (ii) the Executives death, the Company shall pay the Executive in a lump sum the aggregate value of the non-qualified deferred compensation that the Company otherwise would have paid the Executive prior to that date under Section 5(b) of this Agreement. It is intended that each installment of the payments and benefits provided under Section 5(b) of this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code. Neither the Company nor the Executive shall have the right to accelerate or defer the delivery of any such payments or benefits except to the extent specifically permitted or required by Section409A of the Code.",

To the extent that the termination of the Executives employment does not constitute a separation of service under Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code and Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1 (h) (as the result of further services that are reasonably anticipated to be provided by the Executive to the Company or any of its parents, subsidiaries or affiliates at the time the Executives employment terminates), any benefits payable under Section 5 that constitute deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code shall be delayed until after the date of a subsequent event constituting a separation of service under Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Code and Treas. Reg. 1.409A- 1(h). For purposes of clarification, this Section 7(b) shall not cause any forfeiture of benefits on the Executives part, but shall only act as a delay until such time as a separation from service occurs. Further, if the Executive is a specified employee (as that term is used in Section 409A of the Code and regulations and other guidance issued thereunder) on the date his separation from service becomes effective, any benefits payable under Section 5 that constitute non-qualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code shall be delayed until the earlier of (i) the business day following the six-month anniversary of the date his separation from service becomes effective, and (ii) the date of the Executives death, but only to the extent necessary to avoid such penalties under Section 409A of the Code. On the earlier of (i) the business day following the six-month anniversary of the date his separation from service becomes effective, and (ii) the Executives death, the Company shall pay the Executive in a lump sum the aggregate value of the non-qualified deferred compensation that the Company otherwise would have paid the Executive prior to that date under Section 5(b) of this Agreement. It is intended that each installment of the payments and benefits provided under Section 5(b) of this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code.

Except as it otherwise provides, this Agreement is intended to apply to the resolution of disputes that otherwise would be resolved in a court of law, and therefore this Agreement requires all such disputes to be resolved only by an arbitrator through final and binding arbitration and not by way of court or jury trial. Executive expressly waives any right to a trial by jury of claims that would otherwise be so triable and any right to seek or recover punitive damages. Such disputes include without limitation disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability or validity of the Agreement or any portion of the Agreement. The Agreement also applies, without limitation, to disputes regarding the employment relationship, trade secrets, unfair competition, compensation, breaks and rest periods, termination, or harassment and claims arising under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act , Civil Rights Act of 1964 , Americans With Disabilities Act , Age Discrimination in Employment Act , Family Medical Leave Act , Fair Labor Standards Act , Executive Retirement Income Security Act , and state statutes, if any, addressing the same or similar subject matters, and all other state statutory and common law claims (excluding workers compensation, state disability insurance and unemployment insurance claims).

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, any payments and benefits provided under this Section 6 that constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A will not commence in connection with Executives termination of employment unless and until Executive has also incurred a separation from service (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h) ), unless the Company reasonably determines that such amounts may be provided to Executive without causing Executive to incur the additional 20% tax under Section 409A. The parties intend that each installment of the Separation Benefits and the CIC Separation Benefits payments provided for in this Agreement is a separate payment for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(i). For the avoidance of doubt, the parties intend that the Separation Benefits and the CIC Separation Benefits satisfy, to the greatest extent possible, the exemptions from the application of Section 409A provided under Treasury Regulation Sections 1.409A-1(b)(4) and 1.409A-1(b)(9). However, if the Company determines that the Separation Benefits or the CIC Separation Benefits constitute deferred compensation under Section 409A and Executive is, as of the separation from service, a specified employee of the Company or any successor entity thereto, as such term is defined in Section 409A, then, solely to the extent necessary to avoid the incurrence of the adverse personal tax consequences under Section 409A, the timing of the Separation Benefits or the CIC Separation Benefits payments will be delayed until the earlier to occur of: (i) the date that is six months and one day after Executives separation from service, or (ii) the date of Executives death (such applicable date, the Specified Employee Initial Payment Date), and the Company (or the successor entity thereto, as applicable) will (A) pay to Executive a lump sum amount equal to the sum of the Separation Benefits or the CIC Separation Benefits payments that Executive would otherwise have received through the Specified Employee Initial Payment Date if the commencement of the payment of the Separation Benefits or the CIC Separation Benefits had not been so delayed pursuant to this Section, and (B) commence paying the balance of the Separation Benefits or the CIC Separation Benefits in accordance with the applicable payment schedules set forth in this Agreement.",

Employee acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at law available to the Company for breach of any of his or her post-termination obligations under the Employment Agreement or his or her obligations under Sections1, 2, and 3 of this Agreement would be inadequate and that damages flowing from such a breach may not readily be susceptible to being measured in monetary terms. Accordingly, Employee acknowledges, consents and agrees that, in addition to any other rights or remedies that the Company may have at law, in equity, or under this Agreement, upon adequate proof of his or her violation of any such provision of this Agreement, the Company shall be entitled to immediate injunctive relief and may obtain a temporary order restraining any threatened or further breach, without the necessity of proof of actual or consequential damage or the necessity of posting a bond. This provision shall not adversely affect any rights Employee may have under ADEA .",
